# Short Flix - Your Favourite Short Films

## Description

Short Flix is built using Next.js 15, React Server Components, Tailwind CSS, and a FastAPI backend with in-memory data storage. The project structure includes app/ for UI routes, components/ for reusable UI elements, and a modular backend with routers and services. I generated the initial UI using v0 AI, cleaned up unnecessary code, and connected it to the backend API. I used ChatGPT to better understand errors and generate Pydantic schemas for validation, and referred to Vercel documentation to configure request rewrites. With more time, I would add authentication, video file uploads (currently it accepts URLs), the ability to add favorites, search by title, match by tags, sorting by ascending/descending, and more advanced features.
